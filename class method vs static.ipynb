    "### What is Class Method in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "The `@classmethod` decorator is a built-in function decorator that is an expression that gets evaluated after your function is defined. The result of that evaluation shadows your function definition. A class method receives the class as an implicit first argument, just like an instance method receives the instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax Python Class Method:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class C(object):\n",
    "    @classmethod\n",
    "    def fun(cls, arg1, arg2, ...):\n",
    "       # ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `fun`: Function that needs to be converted into a class method.\n",
    "- Returns: A class method for the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "A class method is a method that is bound to the class and not the object of the class. They have access to the state of the class as it takes a class parameter that points to the class and not the object instance. It can modify a class state that would apply across all the instances of the class. For example, it can modify a class variable that will be applicable to all the instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the Static Method in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "A static method does not receive an implicit first argument. A static method is also a method that is bound to the class and not the object of the class. This method can't access or modify the class state. It is present in a class because it makes sense for the method to be present in class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax Python Static Method:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class C(object):\n",
    "    @staticmethod\n",
    "    def fun(arg1, arg2, ...):\n",
    "        # ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Returns: A static method for function `fun`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class Method vs. Static Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between the Class method and the static method is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A class method takes `cls` as the first parameter, while a static method needs no specific parameters.\n",
    "- A class method can access or modify the class state, while a static method can't access or modify it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, static methods know nothing about the class state. They are utility-type methods that take some parameters and work upon those parameters. On the other hand, class methods must have the class as a parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use `@classmethod` decorator in Python to create a class method, and we use `@staticmethod` decorator to create a static method in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use the class or static method?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- We generally use the class method to create factory methods. Factory methods return class objects (similar to a constructor) for different use cases.\n",
    "- We generally use static methods to create utility functions.\n",
    "```\n",
